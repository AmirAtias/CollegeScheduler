# CollegeScheduler
An application for college students.
It displays a Sunday to Saturday  week on a GUI made in JavaFx and allows the user to add,
and save courses onto it.
The reason I made it is that whenever I wanted to create a course schedule for the next semester,
I had trouble organizing myself and deciding which courses to take since there would be so many timing conflicts.
